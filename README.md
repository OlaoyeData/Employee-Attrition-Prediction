# Employee Attrition Prediction
 Employee attrition is a critical challenge for businesses aiming to retain top talent. This project predicts the likelihood of employee attrition using machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Classifier. The prediction helps HR departments proactively address attrition risks. 
# Features
* Analyze and preprocess HR datasets
* Train a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
* Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
* Provide insights into the factors influencing employee attrition.
# Dataset
The project uses a publicly available HR dataset containing the following features:
* satisfaction_level     
 * last_evaluation        
 * number_project         
 * average_montly_hours   
 * time_spend_company     
 * Work_accident          
 * left                   
 * promotion_last_5years  
 * Department             
 * salary                 

The dataset includes a target column left (Yes/No), indicating whether an employee has left the company.
